# 🎰 Lottery System Management using Blockchain (Ongoing Project)

This project is a decentralized **Lottery System** built on the **Blockchain** to ensure fairness, transparency, and immutability. It eliminates manipulation by relying on smart contracts deployed on a public blockchain like Ethereum.

## 🔒 Why Blockchain?

Traditional lottery systems are centralized and prone to manipulation or lack of transparency. By using blockchain:
- 🎲 Randomness is provably fair
- 🧾 Transactions are transparent and immutable
- 🌐 Trustless system — no need to rely on a third party

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📜 Smart contract-based lottery draw system
- 💰 Users can enter by sending ETH (or testnet tokens)
- 🧑‍⚖️ Only the admin (contract owner) can trigger winner selection
- 🏆 Random winner selection using blockchain data
- 🔗 All entries and winners are stored on-chain for transparency
